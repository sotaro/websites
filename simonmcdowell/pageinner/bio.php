<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>My name is Simon McDowell. I’m a half Japanese/New Zealander that currently lives
in Tokyo, Japan. I have been playing drums since the age of 14 years old. A friend
of mine from church got me into playing drums as he left me inspired with his great
performance, which motivated me to start playing an instrument that requires the use
of all four limbs. I also felt that drums would be a much “cooler” instrument to learn
since guitar seemed like the more popular, but also the standard kind of choice (I don't
mean to slander guitarists in any way).</p>
<p>Before I moved to Tokyo, Japan in 2009 I was playing in a lot of bands and doing
a lot of freelance work in New Zealand and Australia. I also taught a lot of private
students in Auckland, New Zealand, where I grew up and lived for most of my life.
I went and studied music at a music technical school and had lessons from a guy
named Paul Russell who is one of New Zealand’s most highly regarded drummers.
He moved to London in 2006 and after that I had lessons for 3 years off a guy
named Frank Gibson Jnr who is also another one of New Zealand’s highly regarded
drummers. While in New Zealand for many years I played many in many different
types of bands including Funk, Jazz, Reggae, Pop, Rock, Punk, RNB, Gospel and
others that I may have forgotten to name!</p>
<p>After moving to Tokyo I have kept on playing for a few different artists and even had
the honor to play in Saitama Arena, which was a big show for me! At the moment, I
currently teach students around Tokyo and play regularly in a Pop/Rock band named
Favorite Underdog. I also do some freelance work on the side as well as uploading
some free lesson videos on YouTube.</p>
